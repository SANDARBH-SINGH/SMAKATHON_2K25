PROBLEM STATEMENT CODE : PS-08
PROBLEM STATEMENT : 
 Blood Donation and Utilization Optimizer

DESCRIPTION : 
 Hospitals and blood banks often face shortages or excesses due to poor
 coordination and prediction. Build a system that connects blood banks,
 hospitals, and donors in real-time. Let blood banks report current stock,
 expiration dates, and blood types needed. Use AI to predict demand surges
 based on seasonality, surgeries, or local events. Donors can get notified exactly
 when and where their blood type is needed most â€” increasing efficiency and
 reducing waste of expired units.
